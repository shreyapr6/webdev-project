            <div class="field" id="pet-grooming">
                <h3>Pet Grooming</h3>
                <p>Dog grooming refers to both the hygienic care and cleaning of a dog, as well as a process by which a dog's physical appearance is enhanced for showing or other types of competition. Grooming is a vital part in the well-being and healthiness of a dog, which can improve its quality of life. How much grooming a dog needs depends on its breed, age, and health. Regular grooming helps to ensure the dog is healthy and comfortable. While many dogs shed, others such as the poodle, do not shed as profusely and require grooming every 4-8 weeks.</p>
                <span>The main reasons for daily grooming include :</span>
                <ul>
                    <li>decreased chance of various health problems, such as thrush, scratches, and other skin problems</li>
                    <li>general cleanliness of the dog</li>
                    <li>monitoring of the dog's health by checking for cuts, hot spots, swelling, lameness, or changes in temperament, all of which could be indicative of illness</li>
                    <li>forging of a closer bond between dog and owner</li>
                    <li>reducing infestation load of external parasites on skin</li>
                    <li>avoid matting that can potentially cause health concerns like skin irritation or the entrapment of harmful bacteria in the coat</li>
                </ul>
                <b>Hair removal</b>
                <p>Hair removal from the coats of many breeds require trimming, cutting, or other attention. While some hair removal has its origins in practical purposes, much is based on the taste of the owner, and what work the dog does.  The rubber grooming gloves and dog brushes are intended to drag loose hair from the short-coated dogs and are some of the most popular grooming tools amongst pet owners. They are easy to use by massaging the coat in firm strokes, and have the advantage of being suitable for both wet and dry coats.Some breeds of dog, such as the Lhasa Apso, do not shed, but have hair that grows constantly.In such circumstances, hair trimming can be performed to keep the eyes clear and keep the coat free of knots.</p>
                <b>Stripping</b>
                <p>Stripping or hand-stripping is the process of pulling the dead hair out of the coat of a non-shedding dog, either by using a stripping knife or the fingers. A hard, wiry coat has a cycle where it starts growing and then sheds as it reaches maximum length. Hand-stripping coordinates the shedding and makes room for a new coat to grow.If done correctly, the procedure is painless. Many dogs are reported to enjoy having their hair stripped, especially when they are introduced to it as puppies.</p>
                <b>Nail trimming</b>
                <p>Nail trimming is essential for maintaining good health. If a dog's nails are allowed to grow, they will curl over into a spiral shape; walking will become increasingly painful. Uncut nails may curl so far that they pierce the paw pad, leading to infection and debilitating pain. Long nails can put pressure on the toe joints, even causing the joints of the forelimb to be realigned. This can cause the animal to have unequal weight distribution and be more prone to injuries. Nail trimming is done with a nail clipper.There are two main types of nail clippers: Guillotine trimmers have a hole at the end through which the dog’s nail is inserted; then, as the handles of the tool are squeezed together, an internal blade lops off the end of the nail. The scissor-style trimmer is most effective on nails that have grown too long and are now in the shape of a circle or coil.</p>
                <b>Bathing</b>
                <p> Dogs should be bathed with warm water, as hot water can scald the skin. Dogs with a heavy or matted coat should never be bathed without first being completely brushed out or clipped of any mats.Many types of shampoos and conditioners formulated for dogs are available. For dense and double-coated dogs, pre-mixing the shampoo with water will help ensure a more even distribution of the shampoo. Do not lather the head, as grooming products can be irritating if they come in contact with the eyes. Additionally, excess water may become trapped in the ear canal, leading to secondary ear infections. Fully rinse the dog after shampooing, as residual chemicals may become irritating to the skin..</p>
                <b>Dental care</b>
                <p>Dental care is very important and can be addressed while grooming. The dental kits available on the market include everything from special toothpaste to toothbrushes. Many models of toothbrushes include a flexible three-head design, which maintains the proper pressure on all surfaces of the tooth with every stroke. These brushes have side bristles set at 45-degree angles to reduce arm twisting and soft outer bristles for massaging the gums. Foaming or rinsing is not necessary.</p>

                <h3>Health Care</h3>
                <p>In addition to feeding and exercising your dog, other aspects of general care are needed to keep your dog healthy throughout its life. These include routine veterinary care for vaccinations, parasite control, and dental care; grooming; and protection from household hazards.</p>
                <b>Importance of Veterinary Care</b>
                <p>Adult dogs should have a complete veterinary examination at least once a year. Puppies need veterinary visits usually every 3 to 4 weeks until they are about 4 months old. Geriatric dogs (older than 7 to 8 years old) should see their veterinarian twice a year or more frequently because illness is more common in older pets and it can be identified sooner. Your veterinarian may recommend a wellness program for your pet, including routine blood work to monitor for problems such as early kidney or liver disease.</p>
                <b>Signs of Illness</b>
                <p>Because you are more familiar with your dog than anyone else, you should watch it carefully for subtle signs of illness that another person or even a veterinarian may miss. General signs of illness include a lack of appetite or decreased activity. Other more specific signs include vomiting and diarrhea, urinating more (or less) frequently, coughing and sneezing, or a discharge from the eyes, ears, or nose. Illness can also show up as a loss of hair or itchy areas on the skin or around the ears. Problems with the musculoskeletal system are often seen as stiffness or lameness, such as not putting weight on a leg. If your dog shows any of these signs for more than a day or two, a visit with your veterinarian is a good idea.</p>
                <b>Giving Medication</b>
                <p>Pills and chewable medications are usually relatively easy to administer to dogs. Most dogs will readily eat a pill that is hidden in a small treat, such as a piece of cheese or a bit of peanut butter. Sometimes, gently holding the dog’s muzzle closed until you are sure that it has swallowed can be helpful. Liquid medications are sometimes prescribed, particularly for puppies. Liquids can be given via a syringe into the rear of the dog’s mouth by inserting the tip of the syringe near the back teeth on either side. Holding the dog’s head pointing partially upward can help prevent spills. Spot-on products or other topical medications are administered directly on the coat or skin. If your dog needs eye drops or ear medication, your veterinarian or veterinary technician will give you a demonstration. Regardless of the type of medication or how it is to be given, it is important to read and follow all label instructions.</p>

                    <h3>Behavioural Traits</h3>
                    <p>Your pup's actions tell you a lot about his mood. Dog behavior problems are often misunderstood or mishandled by dog owners. Perhaps you are new to dog ownership, considering getting a dog, or just wish to help your dog with a challenging issue. Thoroughly understanding the most common dog behavior problems is the first step to solving and preventing them.</p>
                    <span>Here are a list of commonly observed dog behaviours :</span> <br>
                    <br><br>


                    <b>1.Biting</b>
                    <p>
                        Puppies may nip at you as they learn how to communicate with their pet parents. This usually happens while playing, as young dogs often communicate with their mouths when they interact.

                        Before you teach your puppy not to bite, you must first teach the pup that when it does bite, the puppy should bite down gently without much pressure. This is called bite inhibition and it should be part of your socialization program for your puppy. It is not particularly difficult to teach but does require a commitment and consistency from the owner.

                        Beyond puppy behavior, dogs may bite for several reasons, not necessarily out of aggression.
                        <ul>
                            <li> Fear </li>
                            <li> Defensiveness </li>
                            <li> Protection of property </li>
                            <li> Pain or sickness </li>
                            <li> Predatory instinct </li>
                        </ul>
                        <li><a href="https://www.thesprucepets.com/dog-bite-prevention-1117453">More about biting behavior </a></li>
                    </p>
                    <b>2. Circling</b>
                    <p>
                        Dogs who can't stop walking in circles may have a health issue. Yes, sometimes it's fun to chase your tail, but if your pup can't shake the compulsion, there's a problem beneath the surface. Ear infections may cause circling, but compulsive tail chasing may occur with bull terriers.

                        Older dogs may suffer from idiopathic vestibular syndrome, and, not to alarm you, but all dogs are at risk for poisoning or a brain tumor.Only your vet can determine the cause of your dog's circling, so get him in for a checkup.

                    </p>
                    <b>3. Digging</b>
                    <p>
                        Dogs dig in the ground for many reasons: to escape, to track animals, to make a cool spot to lie, or to hide something important to them. However, some dogs "dig" inside as well. Have you ever noticed your dog scratching at the blankets or couch in order to find the perfect place to lie down? This dog behavior happens most often at night and during nap times, and it is completely normal.
                        Certain dog breeds, like terriers, are more prone to digging because of their hunting histories. In general, most dogs dig for these reasons:

                        <ul>
                            <li> Boredom or excess energy </li>
                            <li> Comfort-seeking (such as nesting or cooling off) </li>
                            <li> To escape or gain access to an area</li>
                            <li> Anxiety or fear </li>
                            <li> Predatory instinct </li>
                        </ul>

                    </p>
                    <b>4. Separation Anxiety</b>
                    <p>
                        Separation anxiety is one of the most commonly discussed dog behavior problems. Manifestations include vocalization, chewing, inappropriate urination and defecation, and other forms of destruction that occur when a dog is separated from his owner. Not all of these actions are the result of separation anxiety. Signs of true separation anxiety include:

                        <ul>
                            <li> The dog becomes anxious when the owner prepares to leave.</li>
                            <li> Misbehavior occurs in the first 15 to 45 minutes after the owner leaves. </li>
                            <li> The dog wants to follow the owner around constantly. </li>
                            <li> The dog tries to be touching the owner whenever possible. </li>
                        </ul>
                    <p>True separation anxiety requires dedicated training, <em><a href="https://www.thesprucepets.com/dog-behavior-management-versus-dog-training-1118236"> behavior modification</a></em> , and desensitization exercises. Medication may be recommended in extreme cases.</p>

                    <b>5.  Head Pressing</b>
                    <p>If you notice your dog pressing his head against the wall or another firm object, there's a need for your immediate attention. Head pressing is a common sign of numerous serious problems, such as toxic poisoning or brain disease. Make an appointment with your dog's vet right away.</p>
                    <b>6. Aggresion </b>
                    <p>
                        To say that a dog is “aggressive” can mean a whole host of things. Aggression encompasses a range of behaviors that usually begins with warnings and can culminate in an attack. Dogs may abort their efforts at any point during an aggressive encounter. A dog that shows aggression to people usually exhibits some part of the following sequence of increasingly intense behaviors:
                        <ul>
                            <li> Becoming very still and rigid </li>
                            <li> Guttural bark that sounds threatening </li>
                            <li> “Muzzle punch” (the dog literally punches the person with her nose) </li>
                            <li> Repeated bites in rapid succession </li>
                            <ul>

                    <h3>Nutrition</h3>
                    <p>As a species, the dog is a member of the scientific order Carnivora, a large group of mammalian animals that share a similar tooth structure. As research into basic and applied nutrition has expanded the knowledge of canine nutrition, it is now known that a well-balanced diet must also include an appropriate amount of minerals, vitamins, certain essential amino acids (from proteins), and specific essential fatty acids (from fats). These components are needed to build and maintain tissue and carry out biological reactions.</p>
                    <p>The six basic nutrients are water, proteins, fats, carbohydrates, minerals, and vitamins. These essential nutrients are required as part of the dog’s regular diet and are involved in all of the basic functions of the body. The minimum dietary requirement has been established for many nutrients. The maximum tolerable amounts of some nutrients are known, and results of toxicity have been established. What is less understood is what may happen over time with marginal deficiencies or excesses.</p>
                    <b>Weaning and Feeding Your Puppy</b>
                    <p>If you’re responsible caring for puppies in the first few months of their lives, you’ll need to be prepared to move them from a diet of mom’s milk to regular puppy food. This process of gradually reducing a puppy’s dependency on his mother’s milk, known as weaning, should generally begin between three and four weeks of age and is ideally completely by the time the puppy is seven to eight weeks.</p>
                    <b>Feeding Your Adult Dog</b>
                    <p>Adult dogs require sufficient nutrients to meet energy needs and to maintain and repair body tissues. The amount you feed your adult dog should be based on his or her size and energy output. Activity levels may vary dramatically between pets, and will play an important role in determining caloric intake.</p>
                    <b>Feeding Your Senior Dog</b>
                    <p>Dogs begin to show visible age-related changes at about seven to 12 years of age. There are metabolic, immunologic and body composition changes, too. Some of these may be unavoidable while others can be managed with diet. When feeding your older dog, the main objective should be to maintain health and optimum body weight, slow development of chronic disease and minimize diseases that may already be present.</p>
                    <b>In a nutshell,</b>
                    <p>Choosing a high-quality food from the hundreds of available brands and formulas can be challenging.  Ask your veterinary health care team to help you select a diet that is backed by scientific principles and research and that meets your dog's individual needs.</p>

                    <h3>Exercise</h3>
                    <p>
                        Big or small, young or old, dogs need to exercise daily. While the age and breed of your dog may affect your dog’s ability to exercise, all dogs still need to take part in some form of daily physical activity. Exercise tones a dog’s muscles, helps the body and metabolic system to function properly, and engages the mind.</span>

                    Every day is the gold standard, and a small amount of brushing every day will prevent the build up of plaque and formation of tartar, as well as increasing the bond between pet and owner. However any brushing is better than none, and brushing thoroughly 2-3 times a week should be enough to see a difference in overall oral health.

                    Both products contain enzymes that fight bad bacteria and break down tartar, which prevents plaque from forming. The gel is designed for pets who don't really like having their teeth cleaned - you simply apply the gel to the teeth and the animal spreads it around itself with its tongue. Toothpaste offers a more robust defense against gum disease and tooth decay, as the action of actively brushing the teeth also helps to dislodge food particles and remove the bacterial films that go on to form tartar and plaque. The paste is also meat-flavored, which makes it readily accepted by pets!

                    You can try using the Beaphar Tooth Gel. This requires no brushing, you simply apply a line of the enzyme-containing gel along his teeth, and let his rough tongue do all the work. If he even objects to this, keep him supplied with Beaphar Dental Sticks or Powder. The sticks can be given as a treat, but contain Green Tea Extract and algae that ensure the teeth are cleaned during the chewing process as well as after ingestion. Dental Powder is made out of 100% natural brown seaweed. The product can simply be added to your dog's regular meal. Brown seaweed counteracts bad breath and other dental problems by removing the underlying causes and encouraging the body's natural cleaning process long after ingestion.

                    For the best combination of efficacy and value for money, Beaphar recommends regular use of a Beaphar FIPROtec® Spot On and Beaphar Extra-Long Lasting Household Flea Spray. Ideally, these products should be applied before a significant flea problem has become established, as this will ensure maximum protection from fleas for the minimum number of product applications. If a serious flea problem is already present, quicker results may be achieved by using Beaphar Defest household flea spray together with Beaphar FIPROtec®.

                    Most dogs aren't a particular fan of being washed. Not because they do not like water, but because it feels unnatural and they often don't understand what's happening. For dogs that can't stand being washed, we offer several Dry Shampoo Sprays. These can simply be sprayed upon the dog's coat, and dried off with a towel after having set in a while. These sprays are easy to use and the owner can save a lot of time. Except for the sprays, we also have Grooming Powders, which have a similar method of application. The powder has to be spread upon the coat, but can be dried off after a few minutes. No water needed!

                    Beaphar Lactol is full of vitamins and minerals that will help puppies grow into healthy fully-grown dogs (or other adult animals) The "impurities" you have noticed in the powder are vitamins as well. These will help your puppies in their physical development and growth to make sure that they will get all the nutrients they need. The specs are completely harmless to animals and will contribute to a healthy future!
